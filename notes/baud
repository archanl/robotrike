setting baud rate is critical code.

turn off interrupt
set dlab bit
set baud rate
turn on interrupts

note:
divider = 18.432 MHz / (32 * baud)

LINe high ready to receive:
IN 14
get IIR (interrupt type)
call appropriate function

kick start: turn off serial interrupt and then turn on when interrupt already
dealt with but new byte put into queue
one way to make it non-critical-code.
